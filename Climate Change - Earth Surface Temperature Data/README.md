## Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data
## Exploring global temperatures since 1750

## About this Dataset

### Some say climate change is the biggest threat of our age while others say itâ€™s a myth based on dodgy science. We are turning some of the data over to you so you can form your own view.

### In this dataset, we have several files:

Global Land and Ocean-and-Land Temperatures (GlobalTemperatures.csv):

Date: starts in 1750 for average land temperature and 1850 for max and min land temperatures and global ocean and land temperatures
LandAverageTemperature: global average land temperature in celsius
LandAverageTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the average
LandMaxTemperature: global average maximum land temperature in celsius
LandMaxTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the maximum land temperature
LandMinTemperature: global average minimum land temperature in celsius
LandMinTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the minimum land temperature
LandAndOceanAverageTemperature: global average land and ocean temperature in celsius
LandAndOceanAverageTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the global average land and ocean temperature
Other files include:

Global Average Land Temperature by Country (GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv)
Global Average Land Temperature by State (GlobalLandTemperaturesByState.csv)
Global Land Temperatures By Major City (GlobalLandTemperaturesByMajorCity.csv)
Global Land Temperatures By City (GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity.csv)
